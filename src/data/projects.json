        "description": "This was a fun personal project I embarked on during the COVID-19 lockdown. I wanted to create a virtual art studio and gallery space where people could create artwork and enjoy other people's work online. I wanted to explore the idea of limiting the set of tools available to the user to encourage creativity whilst giving the works a sense of continuity. I used the artistic style of Piet Mondrian, a 20th Century dutch artist best known for his work with perpendicular lines and use of the primary colours to create an online space celebrating this iconic artistic style. This project created challenges in both design and engineering. I enjoyed the interaction design challenge of recreating the painting process digitally and exploring how this could be scaled down to mobile devices. I also devised an interesting method of storing the paintings people produced as binary trees rather than to maximise rendering speed and quality.",

        "description": "I took on this project to meet a brief from Creative Conscience, an organisation encourage creatives to take on socially valuable projects. The brief was to design something to help create conciousness of consumption. I decided to focus on consumption of water and energy in the home. I found that showers are the biggest consumer of water in the home and also burn through a lot of energy. I explored ways of creating a digital product that could enhance the shower experience while raising the user's awareness of the time they were spending in the shower, helping them work towards a shorter shower. My final submission was a mobile application which aims to encourage the user to take a shower for the duration of one perfect shower tune. The app integrates with the user's Spotify account to generate recommendations based on their tastes which can be tweaked based on the user's current mood.",

However, the participants mentioned various barriers to this. Note-taking and form completion were mentioned as requirements that made building rapport more difficult. Additionally, keeping track of what had been covered in order to ensure the required information is elicited, and probing the interviewee for more information, were also commonly stated as reasons why having a natural human interaction may be difficult. All participants also expressed the importance of the two-sidedness of the interaction. Many mentioned how they wanted it to “feel more like a chat” and expressed the importance of being transparent and open with the interviewee. Due to the strong feelings expressed by participants about ensuring the conversation feels natural, it was decided that any solution should have minimal impact on the flow of the interaction between interviewer and interviewee. The focus should be placed on making it easier for the interviewer to be present on a human level, displaying positive body language and actively listening to what is being said. Therefore, interactions with the system should be minimised, subtle and unintrusive of the conversation. It was also felt that taking too many notes, particularly where the interviewee would be unable to see the notes, can be damaging to rapport. This can also be the case if an interview is structured in a way that feels regimented and too much like a one-sided question and answer session. Additionally, some participants mentioned the danger of bias in interviewing, particularly in research interviews. They felt that if the questions are not sufficiently open-ended or if the interviewer leads the questioning along a path of confirming their own beliefs, then there is a danger the output of the interview will become biased. Furthermore, due to the nature of data collected from quantitative research interviews, it can be difficult to ensure all data is documented and insights are surfaced without being influenced by personal bias. Taking a recording of the interview to overcome these problems was met with a mixed reaction. Some felt it was a good way to alleviate the difficulties of note-taking and ensure direct quotes can be documented. Nonetheless, others felt it was too intrusive and would damage the sense of trust in the interaction as well as being very time consuming to process.",

This feature would not be appropriate for all types of interviews but, based on empathetic data, it is felt it may be useful in areas such as qualitative research.

However, this creates difficulties in identifying sections that still need to be completed and confirming that everything has been covered, since the form is many pages long and requires them to go through each page checking each section. Due to the strict time limits and the importance of ensuring all information is covered during the session this creates additional stress, increasing the cognitive load and making it more difficult to build the rapport that is vital in situations such as social work.",

Working closely with Participant B, the idea of using a touch screen device to allow the user to discreetly dismiss components as they are covered was experimented with. Following the definition of a set of components, the user is able to start a session using the predefined components. The components are then displayed on-screen as large buttons and the user is able to tap each one when the component is covered. It then fades or disappears, depending on the user’s preference, meaning identifying components yet to be covered can be achieved through glancing at the screen. The components can also be colour-coded by the interviewer to provide instantaneous visual information about the type of component.",

This was an exploration into the incorporation of playful design into the tool, which aims to “make existing activities and systems more engaging by infusing them with the engaging qualities of games and toys. When discussing his three levels of emotional design, Don Norman explains how products that perform well on the reflective level should be fun to use and provide the user with a story they can tell about it’s novelty. The idea of using bubbles was developed by considering the action of the interviewer tapping a component to complete it, then it disappearing or fading as being similar to popping a bubble. It was also felt that the unordered nature of a group of bubbles could accentuate the sense of fluidity in allowing components to be completed in any order. Participants generally liked this idea and while they felt it may not be appropriate in all cases, some mentioned how it could be useful in making the interview more collaborative and transparent by altering the roles of the interviewer and interviewee to allow them to work together to pop all of the bubbles. Participant F spoke about the potential benefits of introducing a sense of motivation and achievement into the process and agreed it could be useful in conducting research interviews with children. Exploring the effects on rapport of reimagining interviews in this way could be a future area of research.",

Additionally, the participants were encouraged to “Think aloud” to help empathise with their understanding of the system. These techniques are all outlined as part of the methodology for design thinking user testing by Stanford d.school. While the facilitator observed the proceedings, they completed a “Feedback capture matrix”.

While they liked the colour coding, they expressed a desire to split components into more distinct categories to represent the stages of the interview, as well as the ability to make some components higher priority for completion than others.
